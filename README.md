Maximal control, minimal obtrusiveness has long been the hallmark of creativity support. Reframer [1] is functioning platform disrupting the status-quo by combining sketching with CICADA [2], a state-of-the-art AI algorithm for agent-augmented conceptual design. Unlike the vast majority of text-to-image generative systems, users are directly involved in the process of creation, and the AI is capable of making suggestions based on the user prompt. Users can create a sketch and a enter a prompt and Reframer will add strokes and modify the sketch. As this happens, users maintain seamless editorial control as they accept, modify, or reject AI contributions in real-time.

# Step by Step Installation

In order to run Reframer application you will need to run both the client and the server. The server works on CPU although it is much better to use Reframer with a suitable graphics card (GPU). The following steps should automatically install the dependencies but you may need to tweak dependencies depending on your machine/GPU.

Check version is 8 or lower
```
gcc --version
```

If not,

sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt -y install gcc-8
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 8
sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
```

### curl
```
sudo apt install curl
```
